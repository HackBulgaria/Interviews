# Things you need to know

We will try to keep this list technology free - only fundamentals & computer science stuff

## Basic Programming Knowledge

This one is easy - you should be able to implement trivial programming problems without breaking a sweat. If you struggle with this level, continue to learn & increase your skills.

Some basic problems to cover that level:

* Can you sum all integers in a list / array?
* Can you find the 2nd largest element in a list? Or the kth largest? What if the list has repeating elements?
* Can you find all pairs from a list, with a sum equal to some number `k`. For example: `k = 0`?
* Can you give a definition for a function?
* Can you give a definition - what is a set? Which are the basic set operations?

For more basic problems, you can check:

* [The final exam for Programming 0](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming0-1/tree/master/exam)
* [The first week for Programming 101](https://github.com/HackBulgaria/Programming101-3/tree/master/week1)

## Object Oriented Programming

You should be able to answer & give examples for the following things:

* Basic OOP concepts - Encapsulation, Inheritence, Polymorphism.
* Why does the OO concept exists? Do you know the origins of it?
* Why do we need classes?
* What is a constructor?
* What is the difference between a class and an object?
* What is the difference between a method & a static method? When should we use static methods?
* What is method overloading? And what is method overriding?
* Give example for a way to handle errors in our program?
* What is an interface? An abstract class? What is the difference between them?
* What is [SOLID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design))? Give examples.
* Can you give example for dependency injection?

## Data Structures & Algoritms

The fundamentals. You cannot move without them.

* What is a data structure?
* What is an algorithmic complexity?
* Give few examples for container data structures? Do we care about the types we are putting in there?
* What is the difference between an array, a vector and a linked list?
* What are the complexities for each operation in a vector and a linked list?
* How are you going to implement Stack and Queue? Why?
* Do you know a fast sorting algorithm? Do you know a slow one? Can you implement them?
* What is a binary search? What is the difference between it and a linear search?
* What is a tree? How do you implement a tree?
* What is a binary search tree? For what do we use it?
* What does it mean for a tree to be balanced?
* Do you know a data structure, that keeps the tree balanced?
* What is a graph?
* Do you know the basic searching algorithms for graph? For weighted & unweighted? What about complexities?
* Which is your favourite algorithm? Why?

## Gettings things done - practical programming & applications

If you have to build something, you need to cover the following topics:

* What is Git? And GitHub? Can you use them with the basic commands?
* How do you work in a team, using Git? What are branches? What is a merge? What is a rebase? What is a pull request?
* Linux. Basic commands & navigation. Unless you are a .NET developer, you need to run on a UNIX-based system. Mac will do.
* What is a relational database? Do you know the basic CRUD SQL quries?
* Do you know what `GROUP BY` clause stands for? What does it do?
* Can you install & run a RDBMS? For example - Postgre SQL
* Do you know what a package manager is? Why is it important? Give example with the language you are coding in.
* What is a unit test? What is a functional test? What is an integration test? Can you make simple examples for them.
* Can you implement your own ORM framework? What are the ideas there? Can you use some kind of ORM framework?
* What is HTTP? Give examples for client and servers.
* [It is a good idea to take a look at HTTP2](https://http2.github.io/)
* What is your editor of choice? Why? Have you done any tuning & making it more suitable for you?
* Can you build a simple web page using only HTML & CSS?
* Do you know any web framework? Django, Rails? Can you do a Hello World there?
