## Basic Programming Knowledge

This one is easy - you should be able to implement trivial programming problems without breaking a sweat. If you struggle with this level, continue to learn & increase your skills.

Some basic problems to cover that level:

* Can you sum all integers in a list / array?
* Can you find the 2nd largest element in a list? Or the kth largest? What if the list has repeating elements?
* Can you find all pairs from a list, with a sum equal to some number `k`. For example: `k = 0`?
* Can you give a definition for a function?
* Can you give a definition - what is a set? Which are the basic set operations?
