# Roots

Something strange has happened.

In your programming language, the entire `math` library is gone. And of course, you need to find the square root of a given integer.

So, roll up your sleeves and implement this `Math.sqrt(x)` function that we all have been using up until now.

Calculate the square root with precision of `0.00001`.
