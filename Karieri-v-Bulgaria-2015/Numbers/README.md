# Numbers

You, as a leacturer of the algorithms class, have to call all the students to
notify them that the class on Monday will not be held. However, calling each
student individually will enormously increase your phone bills.

You have a list of the phone numbers of all of the students. For each of the
students, you also have the list of phone numbers of other students he or she
has. 

**Your genius plan to save on phone bills is to only call some of the
students and tell them to call the others.**

What is the minimum number of phone calls you need to make in order to ensure
that each student will be notified.

This is an algorithmic problem. How are you going to solve it?
