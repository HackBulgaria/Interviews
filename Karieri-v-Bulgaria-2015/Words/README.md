# Words

Lets play a game!

You are given a rectangular table filled with characters and a `word`.

Your task is to count the occurrences of the `word` in the table.

**The word can be found horizontaly, vertically and across both left to right and right to left.**

## For example

find the word `ivan` in the table:

| i    | v     | a     | n     |
|---   |---    |---    |---    |
| e    | **v** | **n** | h     |
| i    | n     | **a** | v     |
| m    | v     | **v** | **n** |
| q    | r     | **i** | t     |

Result:

```
3
```

## The problem

You are given the rectangular matrix and a `word`. You should output the number of ccurrences.

* How are you going to solve that problem in an OOP language?
* How are you going to model everything?

Give your best!
